# Chch_TrafficAccidentVisualize

## Project Introduction
The main purpose of this project is to visualize all traffic accident information within New Zealand's national borders over the past 10 years on a map. It also provides a series of filtering options, allowing users to view accident information based on different lighting conditions, weather, illumination, and severity. The project uses PyQT5 for interface design and Folium library for map visualization.
